### Welcome to Short-course System

1. Project Overview
It’s become apparent that social engagement is integral when it comes to learning. And often, students have skills that they’re capable of sharing but there’s no internal platform to facilitate this learning engagement. This project aims to develop a system where any member of Wits (including students) may act as content creators and share information in a course structure, while adhering to the “Deep and Meaningful Learning” philosophies. And members of Wits and students will  be able to enrol in the short courses application to learn. The documentation will explain the detailed design of the system.
