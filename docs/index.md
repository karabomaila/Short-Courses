## 1. Project Overview
It’s become apparent that social engagement is integral when it comes to learning. And often, students have skills that they’re capable of sharing but there’s no internal platform to facilitate this learning engagement. This project aims to develop a system where any member of Wits (including students) may act as content creators and share information in a course structure, while adhering to the “Deep and Meaningful Learning” philosophies. And members of Wits and students will  be able to enroll in the short courses application to learn. The documentation will explain the detailed design of the system.

## 2. Architecture
At the start of the development we chose to go with REST architecture. The website requirements were 100% defined.

## 3. Prototyping and Design
After we got requirements from the customer, we started to work  on the design of the software. We did the design using Figma. The link to the design is https://www.figma.com/file/uQ73WnnLPK1UilDOL0qjyx/DFMPC---Sprint1-Design?node-id=5%3A40.

## 4. Development Method
The development method we chose to use is scrum. It allows us to interact as a team and also to communicate with the customer. The client can share experiences with the team.  This approach reduces the risk of losing time and money, and increases the team’s ability to solve complex problems. The software that we use is Taiga, it helped us to do the backlog and the sprints.
